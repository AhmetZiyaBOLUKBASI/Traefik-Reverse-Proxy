# If using LDAP over SSL you should also define the protocol:

# The base DN from where users will be searched within
LDAP_BASE_DN="dc=telia,dc=io"

# The full DN and password of the user used to search the server
# Can both be left as 'false' (without quotes) to bind anonymously

# Set the LDAP version to use when connecting to the server
# Should be set to 3 in most cases.
LDAP_VERSION=3

# Set the property to use as a unique identifier for this user.
# Stored and used to match LDAP users with existing BookStack users.
# Prefixing the value with 'BIN;' will assume the LDAP service provides the attribute value as
# binary data and BookStack will convert the value to a hexidecimal representation.
# Defaults to 'uid'.

# Set the attribute to use for the user's avatar image.
# Must provide JPEG binary image data.
# Will be used upon login or registration when the user doesn't
# already have an avatar image set.
# Remove this option or set to 'null' to disable LDAP avatar import.
# Note: Using this option can increase the likelihood of errors during login

LDAP_START_TLS=false

# Certificate Authority Certificates to use for LDAP TLS connections.
# Generally not needed if using a publicly trusted certificates.
# Value should be a path to a specific CA certificate in pem format,
